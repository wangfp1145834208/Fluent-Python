=============
Tombola tests
=============

Every concrete subclass of Tombola should pass these tests.

Create and load instance from iterable::

    >>> balls = list(range(3))
    >>> globe = ConcreteTombola(balls)
    >>> globe.loaded()
    True
    >>> globe.inspect()
    (0, 1, 2)

Pick and collect balls::

    >>> picks = []
    >>> picks.append(globe.pick())
    >>> picks.append(globe.pick())
    >>> picks.append(globe.pick())

Check state and results::

    >>> globe.loaded()
    False
    >>> sorted(picks) == balls
    True

Reload::

    >>> globe.load(balls)
    >>> globe.loaded()
    True
    >>> picks = [globe.pick() for i in balls]
    >>> globe.loaded()
    False

Check that `LookupError` (or a subclass) is the exception
thrown when the device is empty::

    >>> globe = ConcreteTombola([])
    >>> try:
    ...     globe.pick()
    ... except LookupError as exc:
    ...     print('OK')
    OK

Load and pick 100 balls to verify that they all come out::

    >>> balls = list(range(100))
    >>> globe = ConcreteTombola(balls)
    >>> picks = []
    >>> while globe.inspect():
    ...     picks.append(globe.pick())
    >>> len(picks) == len(balls)
    True
    >>> set(picks) == set(balls)
    True
    >>> picks != balls
    True
    >>> picks[::-1] != balls
    True

THE END
